# Raspberry Pi Security Camera Learning Project

This project represents my exploration into building a custom security camera system from the ground up, designed as both a learning exercise and a foundation for future enhancements. At its core, the system utilizes a Raspberry Pi as the primary computing unit, capturing video feed from an attached camera module and transmitting the live stream to a web-based frontend interface.

## Current Architecture

The system operates on a client-server model where the Raspberry Pi functions as the server, handling video capture and data transmission. I've implemented WebSocket communication as the transport layer, which provides real-time, bidirectional communication between the Pi and the frontend. This choice enables low-latency streaming essential for security monitoring applications. The frontend receives the video stream and renders it for user viewing, creating a complete surveillance solution accessible through any web browser.

## Technology Stack

The backend is built using Rust, a systems programming language that offers memory safety and performance characteristics well-suited for embedded applications. Rust's minimal runtime overhead and efficient resource utilization make it particularly attractive for resource-
constrained environments like single-board computers. The WebSocket implementation handles the streaming protocol, managing connection states and data flow between the hardware and user interface.

## Optimization Goals

Looking ahead, my primary focus involves optimizing the entire system for deployment on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, which presents unique challenges due to its limited computational resources and single-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor. This will require careful consideration of video encoding parameters, frame rate optimization, and memory management strategies. I plan to implement adaptive streaming techniques that can dynamically adjust quality based on network conditions and system load.

## Future Enhancements

The roadmap includes several key improvements: implementing motion detection algorithms to reduce unnecessary data transmission, adding secure authentication mechanisms, incorporating local storage capabilities for recorded footage, and developing mobile-responsive interfaces. Additionally, I'm considering edge computing features like object recognition and automated alert systems that can operate independently of internet connectivity.

This project serves as a practical application of embedded systems programming, network protocols, and real-time media processing, providing hands-on experience with the challenges inherent in IoT device development and deployment.
